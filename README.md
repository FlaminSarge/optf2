## About

OPTF2 is a project that started out as a humble TF2 backpack viewer, but since
then its scope has expanded towards a full Steam information display tool. From
inventories to schemas and more.

## INSTALLATION

* Run pip -r requirements.txt
* Run python dispatch.py for local usage or via wsgi on your server of choice (use dispatch as the entry module)
